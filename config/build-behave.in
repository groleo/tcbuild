menu "Build behavior"

config PARALLEL_JOBS
    int
    prompt "Number of parallel jobs"
    default 1
    help
      Number of jobs make will be allowed to run concurently.
      Set this higher than the number of processors you have, but not too high.
      A good rule of thumb is twice the number of processors you have.
      
      Enter 1 (or 0) to have only one job at a time.

config LOAD
    int
    prompt "Maximum allowed load"
    default 0
    help
      Specifies that no new jobs should be started if there are others jobs
      running and the load average is at least this value.
      
      Makes sense on SMP machines only.
      
      Enter 0 to have no limit on the load average.
      
      Note: only the integer part of the load is allowed here (you can't enter
            0.75 for example).

config NICE
    int
    prompt "Nice level"
    default 0
    range 0 19
    help
      Renices the build process up.

config USE_PIPES
    bool
    prompt "Use -pipe"
    default y
    help
      Use gcc's option -pipe to use pipes rather than temp files when building
      the toolchain.

config CONFIG_SHELL_ASH
    bool
    prompt "Use 'ash' as CONFIG_SHELL"
    default n
    help
      Use /bin/ash as the shell used by ./configure scripts.
      
      ./configure scripts make intensive use of calling a sub-shell, and the
      traditional bash is slow, whereas ash is faster.
      
      Saying 'y' here should be safe enough, but some components may not
      accept using a shell other than bash (this is most probably true for
      old versions). If you have trouble, say 'n' here and see if it fixes it.
