config LOCAL_TARBALLS_DIR
    string
    prompt "Local tarballs directory"
    default ""
    help
      If you have previously downloaded the tarballs, enter the PATH where
      you stored them here.

config SAVE_TARBALLS
    bool
    prompt "Save new tarballs"
    default n
    depends on LOCAL_TARBALLS_DIR != ""
    help
      If you say 'y' here, new downloaded tarballs will be saved in the
      directory you entered above.

config WORK_DIR
    string
    prompt "Working directory"
    default "${CT_TMP_DIR}/_targets"
    help
      Set this to the directory where all build actions will be done.
      
      The default is "${CT_TMP_DIR}/_targets", and leaving this option
      empty will also use the default.
      
      You should not need to change that, except in one very peculiar
      setup:
       - your chainbuilder source directory is on the network
       - you configured chainbuilder with --local
      This kind of setup is a pain, as any action involving source file
      access would have to go through the wire. In this case, you should
      set CT_WORK_DIR to point to a path local to your machine, to avoid
      any network overhead.
      
      Do *NOT* change it if you don't know better.

config PREFIX_DIR
    string
    prompt "Toolchain destination directory"
    default "${HOME}/toolchain/${CT_TARGET}"
    help
      This is the path where the toolchain will be installed and run from.

config INSTALL_DIR
    string
    prompt "Install directory"
    default "${CT_PREFIX_DIR}"
    help
      This is the path the toolchain will be installed into.
      
      Normally, you would set this to ${CT_PREFIX_DIR}, but if for some reasons
      you can't write there, you can install somewhere else and have a third
      person do the install for you.
      The reason you might also want to install elsewhere is if you are going
      to package your shinny new toolchain for distribution.

config CUSTOM_PATCH
    bool
    prompt "Use custom patch directory"
    default n
    help
      If you have custom patches that you want to be applied, say 'Y' here and
      enter the path directory below.
      
      Note that you must ensure that the patch directory is arranged the same
      way the official directory is.

config CUSTOM_PATCH_ONLY
    bool
    prompt "Only use custom patches"
    default n
    depends on CUSTOM_PATCH
    help
      Don't apply patches coming with chainbuilder, only those patches available
      in the directory below.
      
      If you say 'N' here, then the patches provided with chainbuilder will be
      applied first, and then your patches.

config CUSTOM_PATCH_DIR
    string
    prompt "Custom patch directory"
    default ""
    depends on CUSTOM_PATCH
    help
      Enter the custom patch directory here.

config REMOVE_DOCS
    bool
    prompt "Remove documentation"
    default y
    help
      Remove the installed documentation (man and info pages).
      Gains around 8MiB for a uClibc-based, C and C++ compiler.

config INSTALL_DIR_RO
    bool
    prompt "Render the toolchain read-only"
    default y
    help
      Render the directory of the toolchain (and its sub-directories)
      read-only.
      
      Usefull for toolchains destined for production.
